## About Me

I am a data analyst focused on transforming raw data into actionable insights that support decision-making.
My work combines statistical analysis, exploratory data analysis, and business reasoning to understand patterns, evaluate hypotheses, and communicate clear conclusions.

I am particularly interested in market behavior, operational efficiency, and real-world business problems where data can guide strategy.
